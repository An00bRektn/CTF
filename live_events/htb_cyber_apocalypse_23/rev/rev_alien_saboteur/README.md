# Notes

- `vm` is the executable virtual machine and/or runtime 
- `bin` is the crackme we were supposed to reverse that needs `vm` to run
- `patched-bin` is the crackme with ptrace patched out so you can debug it
- `final.py` is undoing the final part of the crackme
- `solve.py` is my scuffed "UWU" file disassembler
