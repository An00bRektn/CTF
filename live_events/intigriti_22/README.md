- Didn't actually "solve" crypto. The encryption algorithms weren't that computationally expensive, so I just bruteforced them
- Credit to [CryptoCat's](https://github.com/Crypto-Cat/CTF/blob/main/HackTheBox/pwn/bat_computer/batcomputer.py) bat\_computer solution for teaching me how to set it up. I just modified the script to get it
- Note to self: Improve your web methodology
