# Whatâ€™s up Bro (formerly brah)

We have noticed some suspicious activity leaving a particular machine in the 
network. We have isolated the machine and recorded its behavior over the course of 
20 minutes or so. Either way it is not a full day so hopefully it was enough to get
what we need for analysis.

We are worried it is exfiltrating some data over a C2 channel but we have not 
been able to pinpoint the channel. Our only indicator is some shady website online
that keeps showing data that has been leaked from our network and specifically data
on that machine!

Please find the C2 channel.

## What To Do

When you find it, the flag is in the format: flag{*.}
