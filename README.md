# CTF
> Why solve what's already been solved?

This repository is dedicated to any scripts I write to solve various CTF challenges as of March 2022. You can find full writeups of select challenges over on my [blog](https://an00brektn.github.io).

**Note**: Do not expect this repo to be organized by any means. I'll try my best, but this is more for me than anyone else :P
